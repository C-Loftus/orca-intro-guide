# Some Applications which are Accessible with Orca

This is a short list of applications on Linux that I have personally tested and work reasonably well with Orca. This is by no means exhaustive. For the latest info consult the Orca mailing list.

## Text Editors

- gnome-text-editor

## Code Editors

- Visual Studio Code

## Browsers

- Firefox (must be launched after Orca to enable accessibility support)
- Chromium 

## Terminals

_Note that many otherwise excellent terminals like kitty or alacritty are unfortunately completely inaccessible_

- gnome-console (also known as `kgx`) 

## Email Clients

- Thunderbird
